“Considering  the enormous variations in  color vision deficiencies, it is difficult to come up with a color scheme that accommodates all types of deficiencies.” — Thomas G. Wolfmaier
                                             
My aim is to provide palettes for certain fixed number of colors whose have the highest possible color difference level.

This repository contains the materials and tools which I used to create these palettes.
Stuff were piled up without order.
