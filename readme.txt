“Considering  the enormous variations in  color vision deficien-
cies, it is difficult to come up with a color scheme that accom-
modates all types of deficiencies.”          
                                             Thomas G. Wolfmaier

My aim is to provide palettes for certain fixed number of colors
whose have the highest possible color difference level.

This repository contains the materials and tools which I used to
create these palettes.
